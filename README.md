# Milk-Quality-Prediction

This project focuses on applying supervised machine learning techniques to classify milk 
quality into three grades—low, medium, and high—using a dataset with 1,059 observations. 
The dataset includes seven features: pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat, Turbidity, and 
Colour. We explored Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Random Forest 
(RF), with a focus on hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and performance evaluation. 
Techniques like hyperparameter tuning, feature standardization, and grid search were 
employed to enhance model accuracy.
